🛍️ Customer Segmentation with Clustering
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project! This project focuses on analyzing customer data and segmenting customers into distinct groups using clustering techniques, making it easier for businesses to understand and target their audience effectively. 🚀

📂 Project Overview
In this project, we utilize machine learning clustering algorithms to classify customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation helps in identifying unique characteristics of customer groups and can improve marketing strategies, product placements, and personalized recommendations.

🧰 Tech Stack and Libraries
Python 🐍: The backbone of our project
Jupyter Notebook 📓: For organizing code, visualizations, and insights in a single, interactive document
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
